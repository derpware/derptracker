# DerpTracker
The derptracker tracks all your derp data from all those derp post privacy services you use and love. Currently supported services are in the "Services" section of this README. If you want to see more services, create an issue, or just build them and send us a pull request. If you are even more awesome, you do both, so we know somebody is working on something.
